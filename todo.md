- [x] in trajectory game definition, add adjacency matrix as an argument
- [x] shared constraint defintion, make the hyperplane parameters come from \theta
- [x] ensure that timestep delta is correctly accounted for. 
- [x] add thrust limits
- [x] compute angle between players for more than 2 players
- [x] Remove environment constraints altogether (instead of just commenting them out)
- [x] Add goals as a parameters
- [x] Num of shared inequality constarints should change w/ adjacency matrix. Important when ParametricGame is built from a game definition. 
- [x] Add differentation wrt goal state
- [x] Add hyperplane plotting function 
- [x] Invert game (follow ParametricMCPs readme)
- [x] Fix stack overflows. Likely good idea to benchmark code to see where it's getting stuck? 
- [x] Figure out how to feed solutions into reconstruction error 
- [x] Modify trajectory game that it's in terms of a setup struct. 
- [x] Make a function for the fancy indexing that I do to extract states only. Use it to refactor reconstruction cost
- [x] ! Setup primals into plotting pipeline so I can re-do the figures in the paper. 
- [ ] Remove Plots.jl dependency
- [x] Make sure forward hyperplanes work for more than 2 players
- [ ] Setup game struct as an actual structure? Should still work with current use of @unpack
- [x] Setup 3-D demo. 
- [x] Add x0 gradient descent
- [x] Warm-start using estimate of previous timestep, as in Xinjie's paper. 
- [x] Re-run MC
- [x] Run MC_inits
