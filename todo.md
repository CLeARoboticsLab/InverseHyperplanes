- [x] in trajectory game definition, add adjacency matrix as an argument
- [x] shared constraint defintion, make the hyperplane parameters come from \theta
- [x] ensure that timestep delta is correctly accounted for. 
- [x] add thrust limits
- [x] compute angle between players for more than 2 players
- [ ] Make sure forward hyperplanes work for more than 2 players
- [x] Remove environment constraints altogether (instead of just commenting them out)
- [x] Add goals as a parameters
- [x] Num of shared inequality constarints should change w/ adjacency matrix. Important when ParametricGame is built from a game definition. 
- [x] Add hyperplane plotting function 
- [ ] Remove Plots.jl dependency
- [ ] Invert game (follow ParametricMCPs readme)
